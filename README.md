# bamazon

The purpose of this app is to display an inventory of items in our "bamazon" store.  By using the command line, the user can view the items and select the item they would like to purchase.  The app will then check the inventory and inform the user that there are enough items in stock for the purchase to be completed.  If there aren't enough items in the inventory, the app will inform the user that they cannot complete the purchase.
